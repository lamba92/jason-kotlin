# JASON PROJECT

This project has been made for the exam of Intelligent Agents of University of Turin. This project include the configuration to run the JASON MAS using IntelliJ IDEA, Gradle with Kotlin DSL and Kotlin.

The project is the example of the domestic robot already implemented in Java by the JASON Team with some additions as requested from the exam.

## How to run
Just clone the repository and open it with IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate or Community edition. If you are in a UNIX environment change the slashes orientation in the run configuration.

If you want to open it using another IDE create a run configuration using `jason.infra.centralised.RunCentralisedMAS` as main class and `.\src\main\resources\config.mas2j` as argument (keep in mind slashes orientation if you are in a UNIX environment).
